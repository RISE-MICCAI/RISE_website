Pulkit completed his PhD in Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Prof. Paul Yushkevich, where he is now transitioning to his new role as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Radiology. Previously, he obtained a master's in computer science in the Shape Analysis Group at McGill University where he was supervised by Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi and Prof. Louis Collins. His primary research focus is to develop computational methods and frameworks to analyze ultra high-resolution postmortem human brain at 7 tesla MRI and link morphometry with histopathology to understand Alzheimerâ€™s and related dementias. He has also spent time as a research scientist intern at Google and Amazon. Pulkit is an active reviewer for IEEE TMI, Medical Image Analysis, CVPR, ECCV, MICCAI, MIDL, and ISBI, and thoroughly enjoys teaching. In his spare time, he loves to explore rare books and manuscripts, and nerd out on coffee.
