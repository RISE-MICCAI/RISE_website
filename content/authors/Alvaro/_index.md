Alvaro Gonzalez-Jimenez is a Postdoctoral researcher at the University Hospital
of Basel and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, focusing on
machine learning for dermatology, particularly in learning from limited and
noisy data. His research explores geometric representations to reduce bias and
enhance model robustness. Alvaro has previously worked at INRIA and NAVER LABS
Europe, received the Best Paper Award at MICCAI 2023, and regularly publishes
at top medical imaging (e.g., MICCAI) and top machine learning conferences
(e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV). He aims to create AI solutions that benefit
diverse healthcare settings.
