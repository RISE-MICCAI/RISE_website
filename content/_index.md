        - # Why RISE?
            - Researchers of under-represented origins (Africa, Latin America, South/South-East Asian, and Middle-East) who work in the field of Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided 
            - Interventions (MICCAI) are barely represented in the community (~around 2% participation to MICCAI 2020).
            - Strengthen the presence of minority researchers from Low-to-Middle Income Countries (LMIC) in MICCAI.
            - Build collaborative bridges across countries and co-develop international cutting-edge research projects in medicine with a wider global outreach and impact.

        - # Mission Statement
            - Propel inclusiveness and geographic diversity within MICCAI,
            - Strengthen the presence of minority researchers in Low-to-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) at MICCAI,
            - Empower MICCAI researchers in LMICs,
            - Pave the way for future research stars to rise in LMICs and under-represented communities, and
            - Build a strong research network within LMICs as well as across continents and different parties to help reduce global disparities in health and imaging.
